    <h1>Renting With Whohousing</h1>
    <p>
      Dogs/Cats OK. Dog or cat must be licensed through the city of Minneapolis & appropriately vaccinated. Dogs must be OK with other dogs on the property (and must not be on (Minneapolis Dangerous Dogs list)[https://www.minneapolismn.gov/resident-services/animals-pets/dangerous-animals/dangerous-dogs-map/] which is not a breed restriction - sorry ya'll had to mention this for my insurance) and not be a nuisance to other tenants.

      No smoking.

      Owner pays trash, sewer, water, snow removal/lawn care, wifi. Tenant pays natural gas and electricity directly to service providers. Shared washer/dryer and secure tenant storage in basement. Apartment has refrigerator and gas range.

      Tenant has to make 2.5x the rent (verified by a paystub, call to an employer, or verification of other means you have to pay the rent / utilities) and have no violent crimes in their background check - but if you do, let me know and we can chat about it. Also required is 2 past landlord references (or a reference from someone youâ€™ve paid rent to / can attest to your character). Background check is $29 through apartments.com.

      Basically, if you are someone who will treat the space well, be a good neighbor, and pay the rent/ utilities on time - welcome home ;)
